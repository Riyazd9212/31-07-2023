<p>He is also the founder and president of YSR Congress Party (YSRCP). He is the son of the former chief minister of Andhra Pradesh, Y. S. Rajasekhara Reddy. He had served as the leader of opposition in the Andhra Pradesh Legislative Assembly between 2014 and 2019. </p>

Jagan Mohan Reddy started his political career by campaigning for the Indian National Congress in the 2004 Andhra Pradesh state elections in Kadapa district. He was elected as Member of Parliament from Kadapa constituency as a member of the Indian National Congress in the 2009 Indian general election. </p>
<p>After his father Rajasekhar Reddy’s sudden death, his popular Ōdārpu yatra, a consoling tour for the people, led him to form YSR Congress Party in 2011.
